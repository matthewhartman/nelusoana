        Born in Romania in 1958, he migrated to Australia in 1989 and
        fell in love with a country comprised of unique fauna and wildlife,
        vast open spaces and vibrant colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greatly influenced by the emotional and enigmatic painters
        of the Expressionist period, particularly Van Gogh, as well as the
        brushstrokes of Australian artist John Perceval, Nelus' works are filled
        with tremendous energy. He combines dramatic, almost violent brushstrokes,
        lavish textures and resonant colors to depict the sinuous beauty of
        Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Henri Matisse once remarked: 'Do I believe in God? Yes, when I am working,
        when I am submissive and modest. I feel myself to be greatly helped by
        someone who causes me to do things that exceed my capabilities.'
      </p>
      <p>
        In Nelus' work there is a similar sense of transcendence, as he explores
        a spiritual relationship with the Australian environment. His energetic
        approach to the creative process is an attempt to engage with the newness
        of nature, and each of his paintings contains the intensity of a newly
        formed, or perceived, landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather then simply being representations of particular locations, Nelus'
        paintings move beyond the canvas into the realm of personal experience and
        subconscious images. They reflect the tension between nature and the human
        element, and celebrate the natural beauty of Australia. Nelus' current works
        draw upon both childhood memories and adult sensibilities, focusing on the
        landscape as both physical and culturally encoded site.

          The prospect of this small opening speech contains a reference that
          could possibly cause some confusion. It says &#8220;From European view.&#8221; Is
          not this specification unstable? Can Australia not be considered a continuation
          or extension of Europe? Shortly after James Cook at the end of the 18th
          century reached Australian shores, the 5th continent became like Great
          Britain's Siberia: Anyone that you wanted to get rid of they would be
          shipped off to the convict colony of Australia. A distinguished translation
          of &#8220;Down under&#8221; would sound like &#8220;ans Ende der Welt.&#8221;(in
          German). Australia soon became the land of the immigrants but unlike
          the USA, in Australia only the whites reserved the right to establish
          themselves. The root of Australia was British but with time also came
          immigrants from other countries that undertook the long journey to the
          southern half of the globe. Not long after the 2nd world war, the grip
          the United Kingdom had on Australia had loosened and the country&#8217;s
          focus was now directed to nationalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Down under&#8221; is now considered somewhat of a quality seal.
          One is proud to come from &#8220;down under.&#8221; The basis of this
          pride is European. Although the USA currently has a strong influence
          on this country and for that matter so to the ever increasing number
          of immigrants from Asia, the basis of Australia&#8217;s identity grows
          as the heir of Europe. This also counts for art...
